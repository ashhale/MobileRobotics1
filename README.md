Mobile Robotics I
=================

I took Mobile Robotics I in the Spring 2016 semester and earned an A in
the class.

Mobile Robotics I focused on autonomous mobile robots, through a series
of lectures and labs. In the labs, we built and programmed robots in
teams. The class culminated in a term project to design, build and
program a robot, and demonstrate it in public.

Our _Maze Runner_ project built an autonomous robot to navigate a real
world maze via cue card directions. The robot has coded behavior that
dictates its reactions to the maze environment.

On this page you'll find our final, [formal project paper][1] and an
additional [close-up picture][2] (shown below). There are also 2 videos.
The [first video][3] shows the robot making 3 turns as instructed by the
presence of red/blue cue cards in the maze. The [second video][4] (on
YouTube) shows the robot realigning itself between the "walls" of the
maze as it detects that it's crossing a line.

For an overview of the course, see [Dr. Martin's class page][5].
